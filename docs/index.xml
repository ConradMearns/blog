      <title>On Blogging and What&#39;s Next</title>

      <description>(I&amp;rsquo;m not a very good blogger.)
In lieu of blogging, I have been researching and soul searching for new and &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; ways of sharing personal information like images and my thoughts. I like writing but I want more control over my potential audience. Technical posts and descriptions of life events seem to be fine concepts for a blog, but I write about so much more than these topics.
When I first deployed this website, I used Hugo (link in the footer) and a few bash scripts that encrypted my documents with a PGP key.</description>

      <description>Physical Build The physical considerations of the project must meet needs of future-proofing, cost, and setup time requirements. The aim of such a project would be to achieve:
 Reliable, RAID-like cloud storage and computing Cheap storage Expandability Intelligent software design  Cluster Hat The Cluster Hat is a deivce that connects multiple Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s together rather simply and gracefully. It connects and powers the Zero&amp;rsquo;s mini USB port, and evern includes a software bundle.</description>

      <description>Well I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty busy recently, as the semester winds down the workload typically ramps up&amp;hellip; So it goes.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to find the time to write here more, and sometimes I have. It&amp;rsquo;s just that so many of my words end up being for me and me alone, and because of that this place continues to look empty&amp;hellip;
Well, to help fight the emptiness, here are some shell renders I did.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Seashells</title>

      <description>In Seashells: The Plainness and Beauty of their Mathematical Description, Jorge Picado describes the mathematics necessary to simulate the shape of a multitude of different seashells. In this post, I wanted to share some renders I created while implementing Picado&amp;rsquo;s math into SciView and how the fourteen parameters function.
Defining the Spiral The parameters D, A, alpha and beta allow us to construct any variety of spiral we want.
D specifies the chirality of the seashell - which direction it spirals.</description>
