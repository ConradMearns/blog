    <p>There&rsquo;s a lot I want to talk about, but I know that I&rsquo;m just creating more work for myself down the road.</p>
<p>I have made a few of recordings of Quantity vs Quality and on 20/80 happiness-scheduling, but I need to start writing these things out.</p>
<p>Upon opening this blog, I found a a nice surprise waiting for me.</p>
<p>I finally got around to figuring out how NixOS aliasing works, and added an alias for <code>nix-shell</code> to <code>ns</code>.</p>
<p>When I opened the blog and ran <code>ns</code>, this message popped up:</p>
<pre><code>Welcome back! Here are your drafts:
-----------------------------------
content/posts/js-test.md
content/posts/project-plans.md
content/posts/time.md
</code></pre><p>I had completely forgotten I did this a few months ago.</p>
<p>There are two small systems at play here, 1 being the alias, and the other being the Project-Specific MOTD.</p>
<p>Small steps lead to big improvements over time.</p>
<hr>
<p>I realise now that I don&rsquo;t need to concern myself with building databases to syncronize application state for stuff like my Scheduler and the Constellation demo.</p>
<p>I have Git, and I have Bash.</p>
<p>Granted, I wont be able to make modifications to the data through my phone, but I probably don&rsquo;t need to yet.</p>
<p>I can make some changes to the way I have approached work, blogging, scheduling, etc.</p>
<p>The tricky bit to this problem is still encrypted information - there is content I want to blog about that should remain more or less hidden.</p>
<p>But I have ways I can solve this issue, by simply redacting the content before it&rsquo;s included in a Git repo.</p>
<h2 id="blogging">Blogging</h2>
<p>I should stop calling the activity &lsquo;blogging&rsquo;.</p>
<p>What I want to do is share my&hellip; logs&hellip; without worrying about crafting perfect stories and driving up engagement.</p>
<p>I jsut want to record my stream of conciousness, and let others benifit from my ideas.</p>
<p>I also  want to craft good stories, research, statements, etc.</p>
<p>I could easily start an approach to these issues, and now I know where to begin.</p>
<p>Scraps will still be append only - but I can easily make an application that extracts portions of text for use in mentions, rewrites, etc.</p>
<p>Pipeline processes can use folders to seperate types of work - and by seperating types of work by folder, I can seperate <code>shell.nix</code> files to change my working environment accordingly.</p>
<pre><code>scraps -&gt; rewriting -&gt; evergreen notes (Cf Sonke How to Take Smart Notes)
introductions -&gt; feedback collection -&gt; outlining -&gt; drafting -&gt; feedback -&gt; rewriting (Cf Julian On Writing)
citations and notes -&gt; scraps
                    -&gt; problem questions -&gt; answers
                                         -&gt; flash cards
scraps -&gt; questions -&gt; hypothesese -&gt; experiments
</code></pre><p>These pipelines aren&rsquo;t built yet, because I don&rsquo;t know how well they&rsquo;ll work.</p>
<p>I will only know how well they work once they&rsquo;ve been built - so it&rsquo;s time to start building.</p>
<hr>
<p>It just sucks that I don&rsquo;t have a better way to include code in this yet.</p>
