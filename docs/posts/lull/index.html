    <p>A &lsquo;Lull&rsquo; is &ldquo;a temporary interval of quiet or lack of activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I feel not yet empty
a bucket with a hole
a soul in a lull
fearing this is forever</p>
<p>to fix a broken bucket
get rid of the damn thing,
cast it into a fire
ignite it
let it burn until spring</p>
<p>scatter the ashes across the trees
scatter the ashes across memories
remember to forget
then forget to remember
a new bucket must be built</p>
<p>build slowly
build carefully</p>
<p>the only way to prevent the leak
is to prevent the bucket
to prevent the water harvest
to prevent the water
forget the leak
forget the water</p>
<hr>
<p>I am not sure how exactly to start.</p>
<p>Currently, I tell myself that I need to draft &lsquo;Permenant Notes&rsquo; for my Zettlekasten.</p>
<p>I can use any number of tools to aide me.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t seem good enough to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve convinced myself that I need something complex.</p>
<p>I need to re invent the wheel.</p>
<p>I need to re invent the paper, and the label.</p>
<p>What the hell is wrong with me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Links should be made manually - delibritaly&rdquo; - the paraphrased voice says to me.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t know how to spell, forgive him. He is a fool.</p>
<hr>
<p>I told myself to build a single page guideline to the process of making a and maintaining a Zettlekasten.</p>
<p>I told myself to hang it on the wall.</p>
<p>How to read, how to note, how to recall, how to write, how to rewrite, how to store, how to surf&hellip;</p>
<p>I need to focus on how to note, how to write, and how to store;;; I think.</p>
<p>I also need to goal set - ultimately, why do I dislike Obsidian, Roam, and other solutions?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I hate the brackets. [[This is not necessary]] - I would much rather prefer perfect transcription, or nameless links that force me to write about what type of linkage is created. Also, &lsquo;This is enough&rsquo; is it not? I can make topics, or &lsquo;Verb Sets&rsquo; by enclosing some words in single quotes. This communicates that I&rsquo;m talking about a set of behaviors which needs to be explained in other locations - other contexts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obsidian&rsquo;s meta data. I want content to be made as simple as possible - a text note should be self contained. What metadata exists, should never touch the file contents. <em>never</em>. Unless, the metadata is a part of the content - but in this case, it&rsquo;s no longer meta eh? This is a sin in my eyes. If I want to parse my data, or implement new meta, I want to play by my rules, not yours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roam is expensive, and gated. The great thing about Obsidian and similar softwares is it&rsquo;s openness. Granted, I see how the money generated for Roam goes directly into Roam&rsquo;s development. I also think that having my data locked away in someone lese&rsquo;s database is deeply uncomfortable. Deeply. It&rsquo;s <em>my</em> data. I hate playing by your import and export rules, I hate being locked out if I don&rsquo;t pay. If Roam were a service to me, I would have a different stance - but there is no algorithm, no magic. Just a database and a slick interface. The user is the magic, and the user pays for that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Futureproofing. I want to esperiment and learn from the data I generate as a whole. I cannot do this with Roam. I can do this with Obsidian, but I am grumpy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The easiest way forward, is to rebuild my notes in Obsidian. To stick with it. And to build my own system on the side.</p>
<p>My own system helps me answer questions.</p>
<p>Or, it will.</p>
<p>It will be it&rsquo;s own language.</p>
<p>It will be self modifiying.</p>
<hr>
<p>I need to sleep.</p>
