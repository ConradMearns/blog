Hi, we're The Browser Company üëã and we're building a better way to use the internet.

Browsers are unique in that they are one of the only pieces of software that you share with your parents as well as your kids. Which makes sense, they're our doorway to the most important things ‚Äî through them we socialize with loved ones, work on our passion projects, and explore our curiosities. But on their own, they don‚Äôt actually do a whole lot, they‚Äôre kind of just there. They don‚Äôt help us organize our messy lives or make it easier to compose our ideas. We believe that the browser could do so much more ‚Äî it can empower and support the amazing things we do on the internet. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre building Arc: a browser that can help us grow, create, and stay curious.

To accomplish this lofty task, we‚Äôre building a diverse team of people from different backgrounds and experiences. This isn‚Äôt optional, it‚Äôs crucial to our mission, as we need a wide range of perspectives to question our assumptions and shape our browser through a bold, creative lens.

With that in mind, we especially encourage women, people of color, and others from historically marginalized groups to apply.

About the Role

As a software engineer working on Reliability, your role will be to improve the performance, stability, and security of our browser, working on the Arc client, server, toolchain, and observability stacks. Your work will contribute to creating a more streamlined, robust, and secure experience for all our members.

You'll be tackling questions such as:

        How can we optimize the performance of our browser across multiple platforms?
        How can we ensure the utmost stability and security while maintaining fast iteration cycles?
        How can we enhance our tooling and observability to better understand and improve our system?
        How do we build and maintain a robust, intuitive, and maintainable codebase?

Overall you will...

        Scope and spearhead technical projects across server, client, browser, and OS layers.
        Creatively design new features and systems that abstract away complexity for product engineers, ensuring stability and velocity.
        Find creative ways to improve reliability via static analysis, CI checks, and tooling.
        Effectively help the team invest in observability, tooling, stability, and performance alongside building new systems.
        Give back to the Open Source community! We believe in upstreaming our work to benefit the larger engineering community who support our product.

Within 1 month you will...

        Get onboarded onto the team and codebase with an onboarding buddy.
        Receive a number of onboarding presentations on how we give each other feedback, the phases a startup goes through, our values, and more.
        Get familiar with Swift, our Chromium architecture, and our build, performance, and stability tooling.
        Have shipped a few bug fixes and features across our codebase.

Within 3 months you will...

        Be familiar with our Swift architecture, and be thinking of ways to make writing stable and reliable features the default for product engineers
        Be involved in weekly engineering discussions about our architecture, how we do code review, code style, and more
        Be involved in infrastructure discussions like how we add better observability to debug issues in production, how we better monitor performance regressions, and how we improve our crash rate and stability metrics
        Be regularly posting feedback about using the browser in our #dogfooding channel

Within 6 months you will...

        Be interview trained and interviewing candidates for roles at the Browser Company
        Be familiar with C++ and how we interact with and build on top of Chromium
        Be adjusting our terraform config to deploy new infrastructure or update our build pipelines
        Be leading projects from conception to production launch
        Be mentoring and pair programming with newer engineers to help them get spun up on the codebase

Qualifications

        You have a strong track record for leading critical reliability projects or initiatives for a large, complex application
        You have experience working on large, complex codebases.
        You have a deep understanding of systems and how to optimize them for better performance, stability, and maintainability.
        You are passionate about creating tools that make engineers' lives easier.
        You appreciate a well-configured, maintainable build tooling system.
        You're pragmatic and can see the bigger picture; you're able to reason about prioritization and scope
        You have a bias towards action, moving quickly to implement new systems and features.
