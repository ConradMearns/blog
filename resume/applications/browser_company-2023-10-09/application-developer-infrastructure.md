As a Developer Infrastructure Engineer at The Browser Company, you will create tools, systems, and scripts that empower our teams to ship features to members quickly and safely. You’ll build software that answers questions like–

        How do we get the Swift developer environment on Windows to rival that of C# on Windows or Swift on Mac?
        How do we improve our build times, and make our builds more stable?
        How do we improve the Swift debugging experience in VSCode?
        How do we improve our UI testing framework’s reliability and reduce flakiness?
        How do we push the cross-platform Swift ecosystem forward, with new libraries, blogposts, or compiler improvements?

Overall you will...

        Scope and spearhead technical projects across our Windows and Mac developer experience, including within our toolchain, builds, developer tooling, and app architecture.
        Design APIs and tools that abstract away complexity and allow product engineers to iterate quickly, collaborating closely with other engineers across the company.
        Ensure product development is progressing quickly by finding and fixing inefficiencies in the appropriate layer of the system.
        Dig into various layers of our development stack, including our compiler, dependencies, editor, language server, and build system, to improve performance and ergonomics.
        Give back to the open source community. We believe in upstreaming our work to benefit the community that we benefit greatly from.
