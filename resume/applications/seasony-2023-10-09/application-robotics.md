To grow our R&D team, we are seeking a highly motivated Robotics Software Engineer with experience in motion planning, navigation or controls to support the development of the next iteration of our first product.  

Our mission at Seasony is to make indoor farming more profitable, scalable, and sustainable. Indoor farming (Vertical farms, greenhouses, insect farms, etc.) is a crucial piece of the puzzle to solve some of the challenges in the food and agricultural transformation the world is going through. Our flagship product, the autonomous mobile robot "Watney," helps indoor farms by automating core processes and provides growers with valuable data insights. The robot consists of a mobile platform, a lift, and a modular top. 

As Robotics Software Engineer, you will be developing software for the robot using the ROS middleware and deployed on a Linux-based computer. Experience working with hardware and embedded software development is a plus.  

 

Role responsibilities:  

    Develop motion planning algorithms 

    Design and implement behavioral trees or state machines
