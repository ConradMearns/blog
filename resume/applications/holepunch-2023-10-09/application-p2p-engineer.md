About Holepunch


At Holepunch, we’re building a peer-to-peer development platform that lets you build apps that don’t require infrastructure. No servers whatsoever. Holepunch apps can be deployed to users directly from the machine you develop on, and scale effortlessly. Since servers are removed from the equation, users retain full control over the data they create, keeping things maximally private. The benefits of peer-to-peer are innumerable, and we envision a world where everything is peer-to-peer by default. We’ve started demonstrating what this future will look like with Keet, our P2P communications app.

Holepunch is built on a battle-hardened, Node.js-based technology stack we’ve built called Hypercore, which provides the basic machinery for establishing peer-to-peer connections and replicating data in a fashion similar to BitTorrent. 

Currently looking for:
