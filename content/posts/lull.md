A 'Lull' is "a temporary interval of quiet or lack of activity."

I feel not yet empty
a bucket with a hole
a soul in a lull
fearing this is forever

to fix a broken bucket
get rid of the damn thing,
cast it into a fire
ignite it
let it burn until spring

scatter the ashes across the trees
scatter the ashes across memories
remember to forget
then forget to remember
a new bucket must be built

build slowly
build carefully

the only way to prevent the leak
is to prevent the bucket
to prevent the water harvest
to prevent the water
forget the leak
forget the water

I am not sure how exactly to start.

Currently, I tell myself that I need to draft 'Permenant Notes' for my Zettlekasten.

I can use any number of tools to aide me.

They don't seem good enough to me.

I've convinced myself that I need something complex.

I need to re invent the wheel.

I need to re invent the paper, and the label.

What the hell is wrong with me.

"Links should be made manually - delibritaly" - the paraphrased voice says to me.

He doesn't know how to spell, forgive him. He is a fool.

I told myself to build a single page guideline to the process of making a and maintaining a Zettlekasten.

I told myself to hang it on the wall.

How to read, how to note, how to recall, how to write, how to rewrite, how to store, how to surf...

I need to focus on how to note, how to write, and how to store;;; I think.

I also need to goal set - ultimately, why do I dislike Obsidian, Roam, and other solutions?

1. I hate the brackets. [[This is not necessary]] - I would much rather prefer perfect transcription, or nameless links that force me to write about what type of linkage is created. Also, 'This is enough' is it not? I can make topics, or 'Verb Sets' by enclosing some words in single quotes. This communicates that I'm talking about a set of behaviors which needs to be explained in other locations - other contexts.

2. Obsidian's meta data. I want content to be made as simple as possible - a text note should be self contained. What metadata exists, should never touch the file contents. _never_. Unless, the metadata is a part of the content - but in this case, it's no longer meta eh? This is a sin in my eyes. If I want to parse my data, or implement new meta, I want to play by my rules, not yours.

3. Roam is expensive, and gated. The great thing about Obsidian and similar softwares is it's openness. Granted, I see how the money generated for Roam goes directly into Roam's development. I also think that having my data locked away in someone lese's database is deeply uncomfortable. Deeply. It's _my_ data. I hate playing by your import and export rules, I hate being locked out if I don't pay. If Roam were a service to me, I would have a different stance - but there is no algorithm, no magic. Just a database and a slick interface. The user is the magic, and the user pays for that.

4. Futureproofing. I want to esperiment and learn from the data I generate as a whole. I cannot do this with Roam. I can do this with Obsidian, but I am grumpy.

The easiest way forward, is to rebuild my notes in Obsidian. To stick with it. And to build my own system on the side.

My own system helps me answer questions.

Or, it will.

It will be it's own language.

It will be self modifiying.
