+++
I cannot say that my mind is focused
I cannot say that my mind is distracted
nor blinded, bewildered, hindered or strained
but I cannot say my mind is focused

I wonder what tomorrow holds, and I wonder I will feel.

I am the calm sea, and the captain which sails upon it. I am the lazy driver behind the car, and I am the car. I see all that is to be, all the must be down, and I have no intention of doing it.

It will be done.

I am peace
I am tranquility
I am also lonely
But I have all the company I need. Or do I?

Tomorrow only holds more company, time will bring me more people to converse with, more friends more bars more joints on the couch. More philosophy, more science, more math. More love. More touch.

I know this, and I still feel lonely.

Self love will not pay, pride will not owe.

__Pride will not owe__

I miss my pride. I need my pride. I will have my pride.

I will become more organized.

I will forget virtue.

I will forget my name.

But I will not forget what tomorrow holds: pride, my time, and creation.
