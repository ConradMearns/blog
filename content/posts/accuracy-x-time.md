> Freewriting for 20minutes - mistrakes galore!

One of my more recent goals is to abandon the idea of 'projects' as a categorical method for organizing tasks and time. There are a few ideas that all relate to this;

- Projects are too goal oriented, they cause us to lean into analysis paralysis and we get overburdened by perfectionism. 'My Project is too personal to take shortcuts! That's not who I am!"
- Projects only grow - they collect features, tasks, and tedium. The are a cancer, they swallow our time and through this process, we inevitably lose interest because we accomplish the best tasks first, and get burnt out.
- A 'project' is difficult to define - A person who studies is a Student. A person who reads is a reader/bookworm. A person who writes is an author. Who is the person that does projects? A tinkerer? A creative? A project-doer? A maker? When we consider these titles, we see different images. Mkaing the 'project' our goal misaligns our identity - or worse, _the project becomes our identity_.

Solution: abandon projects forever.

To reduce bloat with our tasks, we must avoid the creation of tasks and tedium. We must find a way to build and 'Garden' without focusing on the goal. We can do this by building a system for task completion that not only permits failure, but _begs_ for it.

Every task we preform is an 'Implementation Task' - a set of related actions which leads to a desired state. The imperitive nature of ~IT means that there is a lot of room for minute changes in each consequtive execution. Mkae coffee with a French Press, how many beans do you add? for how long are the beans ground? how fine? how much water is added? _how_ is the water added? how fats is the water added? how long do you wait until plunnging the filter? for how long do you plunge? ... Each of these questions refers to the ever-minute implementation details that may change when we mention the 'Declarative Task' of "making coffee". We may even do away with the french press altogether and use a poor-over even - sometimes the implementation doesn't matter.

If you're like me, you care enough about those details to ultimately tell yourself that the details _do_ matter. French Press makes a different coffee than poor-over, which is different from Aeropress and Espresso; why?
And no, I don't care about why the coffee is different (at the moment) - I mean why do we care about the difference at all?

How can we even know?

Experimentation is the system of making a hypothesis, preforming the ~IT and evaluting the results. Consider the first time you made french press - perhaps you added too many beans, not enough water, the beans were partially ground too much, and all you had in the end was a dirty, grainy, bitter "coffee" in the end. The experiment failed, but through that experience you created new hypothesis; grinding amount, water quantity, etc, all were the independant variables in your experiment and in your next attempt, you changed them.

All tasks we aim to complete should be understood in the way of experiments. We must fabricate a simple plan, guided by our hypothetical outcome, and allow ourselves to fail.

Instead of defining the project, and it's scope. We simple fabricate a list of all of the experiments we want to run. And we evaluate them one by one.

---

The most simple outcomes for any task are Accuracy, and Time.

If we start a task with the ~DT definition, we can examine the difference between the potential ~DT and the ~IT to evaluate how close we came to completing the ~DT.
If the ~DT was to make coffee, and we made dirt water that tastes like coffee, then perhaps we got close, but we didn't quite make it. Accuracy was 40%.
Time is even simpler to evaluate - how long did it take? A 1 hour coffee is much different from a 1 minute coffee. This information speaks volumes about our estimation skills, and technique and efficiency.

---

Accuracy is limited to 0% and 100%. Never negative (maybe?) and certainly never above. [0, 1]
Time is never negative, and never zero. (0, inf)

This implies that even if you find a way to improve technique by insane amounts, the curves describing accuracy can never be exponetial - it's logistic.
Time may be exponential, but never non-zero.

I went over my 20 minutes on this, but I don't know the exact time. Shoot!
My next goals will be to start creating templates for experiments. Examples are very important to me - from them I can easily derive all other things.

'topic' -> preprocess into 'Topic'
single quotes around a topic should link to topics instead of [[this shit]]
~shorthand replacements??
