(I'm not a very good blogger.)

In lieu of blogging, I have been researching and soul searching for new and "better" ways of sharing personal information like images and my thoughts. _I like writing_ but I want more control over my potential audience. Technical posts and descriptions of life events seem to be fine concepts for a blog, but I write about so much more than these topics.

When I first deployed this website, I used Hugo (link in the footer) and a few bash scripts that encrypted my documents with a PGP key. My thought was that by doing this, I could keep my thoughts backed up and then have better control over which posts got included in the blog, and what didn't.

Then I lost the PGP key.

I eventually found the sources on a thumb drive and was able to recover my rants and posts, but I needed a better solution. School got busy, I got busy, and I put my search on hold.

The project largely escaped my mind - I let the domain expire and stopped writing completely. That was, until I found out about [Project Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu). This project led me down a wonderful rabbit-hole of ideas and similar projects. I began to find some interesting digital Zettlekasten online, and wanted to make my own. (Cf [Memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex), [Szymon Kaliski's Notes](https://szymonkaliski.com/notes), [Andy Matuschak's Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes)).

The more I thought about these projects and the note system I wanted to build, the large the project became in my mind, and I kept drifting away from a solid foundation. So, in lieu of blogging, I started a digital diary. The friction that has developed between my diary and me is steadily growing though, and I'm getting closer to defining my foundation so that I know where to start, but I'm still a ways off. School is still a priority above all things, and my health priorities are close behind (though they should be first...).

----

# The Next Priorities

There are a lot of conflicts, ambiguities, and workflows that I need to resolve before I know what to program. I've decided that many of these issues can potentially be resolved by creating 'toy' programs. So far, I'm thinking that these toy programs would best be built in Javascript (probably with p5js) so that they can be demoed from anywhere. Beyond this though, the only tasks I have ahead of me lack enough information for me to build sentences to describe them.

What I really need to do next is map out all of my desired features and long term systems. I think I know the overall theme, but seeing the goals is like trying to recite a monologue underwater.

Two themes:
- Make computers fun to _use and break_
- Bring the power of data back to _the people_


----

In short though, here are some topics I've been researching in the past year.
