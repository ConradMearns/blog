I am trying to find the words

that may motivate and inspire my future selves.

I am not sure that I can

so I will aim to motivate my past selves - the only ones I have known.

"What is the purpose of life?" is, as we know, too vague a question. It's only surpassed the supreme question ("Why?") and offers very little motion into a definitive answer.

The vision that we once saw, was reminicent of Borges' Librarians - though they were faceless and did not wander past infinite shelves of books.

They were gardeners, biologists, chemists, programmers, zealots - all one and the same.

In the vision, the Gardener saw one of their many plants was dying - a trail of soured vines led the path to the plant.

They knew the sign in the sour plant and followed it across hills and valleys - through tunnels and mazes. They came to a forest clearing, wherin sat the plant.

Cancerous, and overgrown The plant looked more like a balloon animal than anything else in the garden.

The Gardener simple pushed their hands within, past the plastic membrane of the creation, within a new dimension stricly contained only within the plant.

When the hands came out, in them were gripped a series of elastic tendons, tangled and braided - colored, pulsing, vibrant and bright.

The gardener got to work, cutting and reconnecting. Eventually the work was done and the plant deflated. For now, at least.

The vision was to create this dream - to find the minimal encoding of behavior so that each intention to push our will into this world was as simple as growing a plant.

Plant the seed, and water from time to time. The enviornment, and the time we dedicate should lead the plant to it's next natural state.

Programming, does not work this way. As such, our desires for something better cause us to break down constantly.

We dream of assurance, we dream of comfort, we dream of a garden.

How do build into this garden?

The Zettlekasten seemed the seed, the spark.

From our beginning there, we started to enjoy the ample energy added to our conversations. But it didn't last.

Why?

---

Perhaps now, with the slow decay of our dream, and our growing frustration and dying memories, it is time to restructure completely.

Our purpose was to find the ways in which we could garden, for the sake fo the act alone.

This dream is dying.

Now, we must try something anew.

What is the ultimate purpose of such a work? Are we truly gardenning simply to garden?

If we are, wouldn't it be better to let the garden control itself, and grow naturally?

What we found, is that without our intervention, no garden will grow at all.

Are we truly gardening?

This is all besides the point.

---

When I die, the garden may remain. At this point, the garden will surely die soon after.

This is unacceptable.

The fear sets in upon this thought - which clears way to the answer.

Gardening is not the goal. Inspiration is the goal preservation and movement of ideas is the goal.

Gardening is one of many means to this end - if you can call it that.

---

To reframe our ideaolgy around this, will not be easy, but it is necessary.

Our engine is to build other people up - to inspire them to act, to write, to spread ideas.

This is the purpose of Constellations.

This is the purpose of Radish.

This is the purpose of habit-wise study.

This is our purpose - not to fight the void, but to fight the couch.

---

All avenues must lead here.

All arguements, all actions.

Even arguements of nihilism must lead here - if the arguement is to give up, so that all of the universe may return to nothingness, the fastest way to such an end is by expanding all energy as fast as possible.

I intend to being work on the Molyb again.

My thoughts are sparse and scattered, I will probably not get far.
