Well I've been pretty busy recently, as the semester winds down the workload typically ramps up... So it goes.

I've been trying to find the time to write here more, and sometimes I have. It's just that so many of my words end up being for me and me alone, and because of that this place continues to look empty...

Well, to help fight the emptiness, here are some shell renders I did. I was asked to enter these in an image competition, but first I'm releasing them here under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

__If you haven't seen my other post about shells__ then visit it, I talk a little bit about how they're generated and link to the paper this is based off of.
