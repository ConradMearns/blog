For a while now, my website hasn't had a link to the 'blog' section.
These posts have been hidden behind obscurity, the only place to know they exist is through Github.

Well, as I look towards my [New Year's Goal](2022-12-31 New Year.md) of blogging more, I find more need to admit to myself that I've got to tone down my expectations for myself.

I wanted to make as much of this site from scratch as possible - all of the styling up to today (if you're reading this past the posting date - then this probably no longer applies.) - I made from scratch. It really isn't much, it's just a minor feat for me because I have no idea what I'm doing and very little practice put into web design.

So, I think I'll be shifting to a template? I need to have something thats usable by myself and those who access the site. I can customize and tweak things later.

There's also going to be more need for this as I start working out a process for constructing build logs of hobby projects I'm working on. These will need to be organized, and easy to move between. Not entirely sure what my game plan is yet.

Most of the time, braindumping and process collection occurs via Obsidian. I'll just casually slap snippets, code, screenshots, and thoughts into a document and then promptly forget about it. It serves me pretty well - but it needs to be put through more stresses.

One of the larger obstacles with this process is getting Images synced to where they need to be. I really don't want to muck around with manually moving files all the time, so I've set up a system using a new NixOS server, Syncthing, and Zertotier to get the job done. Details coming soon?

There are so many other items on my blogging wishlist, it's rather painful to try and keep track of it all. But, first thing is first, I have to build some new habits, and deliver some more basic content first.

That's the important stuff, I still have some minor thoughts wanting to move into my fingertips, so if you stick around - apologies for incoherency in advance.
