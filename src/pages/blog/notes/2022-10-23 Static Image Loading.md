For some reason, I can't get the style to apply from the `Layout` file. That's annoying. I'm not really feelin this task at the moment now, so maybe I'll come back to it later.

I'd like to understand how images in [Astro](https://astro.build) work because from what I understand, this could save me a ton of time building a better gallery.
