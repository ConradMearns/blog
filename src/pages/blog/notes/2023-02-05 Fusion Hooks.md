Fusion docs aren't up to date. I've been looking for this option for days now

I'm trying to add a knob at the end so I can do things like hang router/access points. We'll see how it goes!

The first one came out good!

I made some measurements on the back of my Router to make one last adjustment - as it's little rubber feet will make it stand off of the wall a tad.
