    <p>
        This list of posts is being interpretted at build time via the `/rss.xml` endpoint I have exposed.
        Astro Components are meant not to be sent to the client, so this list is not dynamic.

    This was supposed to read the /rss.xml and built a static endpoint, however this fails during build time.
    It works during dev-runtime
