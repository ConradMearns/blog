# Objective
Results-oriented "Full-Stack" Engineer with a wide background in frontend, ETL, microservices, cloud technologies, embedded development, and rapid prototyping. Passionate for pair programming, mentoring, and DevX practices to accelerate growth. Seeking to solve meaningful problems in the World and Web today.

# Professional Projects
- **ML + RF on the Edge:** Lead integration for signal processing and machine learning algorthims to hybrid RTOS+FPGA devices.
- **Global Trade ETL:** Built many highly flexible caching ETL systems for multiple Global Trade datasources.
- **Cyber Data ETL:** Improved the robustness, performance, and adaptability of legacy cyber ETL systemes responsbile for multiple terabytes of writes per day.
- **Database Migration Tool:** Wrote a lightweight alternative to FlywayDB to support legacy MsSQL and Postgres migrations for multiple projects.
- **Functional Deployment Abstraction:** Constructed a framework for automatic architecting and deployment of functional Python to monoliths or distributed on-prem devices, with extensability to support CDK deployment for multiple projects.
- **Radiation Portal Monitor Project Cloud Migration:** Migrated and rewrote legacy C# applications to enable scaling raidological data storage efforts.
